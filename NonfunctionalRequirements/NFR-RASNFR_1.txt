[JS] The fit criteria is specific, however the time may depend on factors outside the control of the product such as the user's internet connection.  Hence 100% may not be achieveable.
[RS] Agreed. During internal testing, when internet connection factors should be mitigated, I would be expect 100%, but for user acceptance it's agreed that 100% may not be achievable. However, the search should still resolve within 10 seconds, so set to 95%.
