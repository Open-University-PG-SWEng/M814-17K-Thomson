REQ-ID: NFR-DPA

	   Note: This NFR is global and applies to the entire project’s data storage concerns.

Fit Criterion: Lawyers' verification that the product, and the proposed use of it, does not break any laws; with ‘100%’ certainty -  as far as you can trust lawyers.

Originator: Derived from function: hotrod1.


Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.

[DUB] : I find the fit criterion ok. However, I found the sentence in the “ Description” a little bit too long. Why not just say “the product shall be secured”.

[DN]: The need for 100% certainty in the fit criterion is correct in my opinion.
[SD]: As data protection being more stricter, I think the fit criterion is the only way to measure the NFR.

[MM]Referring to an earlier comment that the description should perhaps say only “the product shall be secured”; I beg to ask the question:  

	Against what? Rampaging buffalo, perhaps? 

It would be interesting to see an FC written against that suggested description! Any takers?

[MM]But seriously folks – don’t you think legally based NFRs’ look and feel just like constraints?
