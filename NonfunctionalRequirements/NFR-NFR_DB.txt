REQ-ID: NFR_DB
Description:  User Interface for Cancelling a Booking must be distinct and intuitive
Type: Usability
Rationale:  The customer must be able to find and use this feature easily, but also must not accidentally trigger it.
Fit Criterion:  Customers can find and use this feature with a 95% success rate (ie without having to call), with no more than 2.5% of customers using it accidentally.
Originator:  DB – inferring from Functional Requirement DUB002
Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.

[BIB] The wording of this non-functional requirement is a little unclear. It starts in the description by referring to "important operations", however the rationale goes on to talk about the single feature this NFR appears to be based on: cancelling a booking. In addition, the fit criterion needs to be more specific, phrases like "good success rate" and "minimal accidental use" are too open to interpretation. Try something like: "95% of customers should be able to cancel their booking through the product without the need to phone Landbnb".
[JS] The fit criteron is not readily measureable, no scale is given for how we assess success rate and accidental use, and no objective pass/fail criteria is given.
[SD] The fit criterion needs more specific measure like n% of the users find the website easy to use, or to specifically measure the length of website-use and acitivity on it.    
[DB] amended - description now correct, fit criterion now specifies a level of success.

[JB] The modifications made to the NFR are much better than previously discussed by other user feedback. Although, unless the user were to close the browser, assuming that the program offers some kind of 'warning, do you wish to proceed with cancellation option?' then I would expect the number of times people accidentally cancel a booking to be far less, maybe even 0%. Because, even if someone accidentally pressed the initial cancellation button, they would backtrack when they saw the warning message.
