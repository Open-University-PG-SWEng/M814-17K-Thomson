REQ-ID: MS01
Description: The product shall clearly ask for special arrangements on the booking
Type: 11 Usability and Humanity Requirements
Rationale: In the booking process it is important to clearly ask special arrangements to avoid contacts by phone and abandonment on the booking process
Fit Criterion:
	* At least 90% of special arrangements must be filled on the booking process and not by phone 
	* Less than 10% of booking abandonments should be at filling special arrangements step
Originator: Mauro Szuchman
Comments: [DN] I think the fit criterion is pretty good, I would edit the first part to say: "at least 90% of special arrangements organized on the website should be filled by the website booking process and not by phone".


[cs] this requirement need to specify which event would trigger the product to ask for "special arrangement on booking". is this triggered when data field in the booking user interface is left blank or some other queue? it's not clear in the fit criterion. 

[MM] At first I thought this is very close to being a humble FR: As a matter of course, a programmer could have a modal selection come up that would force the user to clearly decide how to proceed at the appropriate point. 

I now understand that the NFR bit of this is an imperative caution, so it is valid; although it can easily be achieved by the coder; 100% of the time.

	Thanks DN! I agree with you, I will remove "weekly"
	Thanks CS! If I understand well your point, I see it as part of the solution and it wouldn't be part of the requirement
	Thanks MM! It is a possible as a solution, but in this instance we have to review the fit criterion
