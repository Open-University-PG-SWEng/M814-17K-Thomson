REQ-ID: PS01
Description: The product shall be able to retrieve bookings in a reasonable amount of time.
Type: 12 - Performance
Rationale: Retrieval of the bookings shall be part of multiple product use cases, e.g. it shall be part of checking for overlapping booking that must be done as quick as possible so the potential customer does not lose interest. Potential customers will wander away from the website, if loading takes more than a few seconds.
Fit Criterion: It is possible to retrieve a booking in under 5 seconds 99% of the time.
Originator: inferred from REQ-ID: PS18

Comments: [DUB]. I find the fit criterion ok. However, the term “The flow of work should not be interrupted by loading time of bookings” might be too technical for the stakeholders. Consider using a less technical word. 
More so, “2 seconds 100% of the time” might not be achievable. Have you thought of the time/period of malfunction of the product?
[DB] as stated by DUB, the fit criteria is not likely achievable - it requires that no problems occur outside this operation.  The criteria should specify a standard or expected base level of performance - malfunction/error handling would be outside of this requirement. 

[MM]Good. Although I agree with above comments: 2 seconds is a bit optimistic.  Also I would add (here, and in many of these performance metrics) the term, ‘…..under normal operating conditions’, for obvious reasons.
