REQ-ID: PS01
Description: The product shall be able to retrieve bookings in a reasonable amount of time.
Type: 12 - Performance
Rationale: Retrieval of the bookings shall be part of multiple product use cases, e.g. it shall be part of checking for overlapping booking that must be done as quick as possible so the potential customer does not lose interest. The flow of work should not be interrupted by loading time of bookings.
Fit Criterion: It is possible to retrieve a booking in under 2 seconds 100% of the time.
Originator: inferred from REQ-ID: PS18

Comments: [DUB]. I find the fit criterion ok. However, the term “The flow of work should not be interrupted by loading time of bookings” might be too technical for the stakeholders. Consider using a less technical word. 
More so, “2 seconds 100% of the time” might not be achievable. Have you thought of the time/period of malfunction of the product?



[cs] the Fit fit criterion will be hard to verify when the website go live becuase network speed will very and no error will be generated or no sensible way of measuring this fit criterion in the field.
