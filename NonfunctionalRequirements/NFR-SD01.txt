REQ-ID:NFR-SD01

Description: Dates of availability of a property should be refreshed/ reloaded in every 5 seconds. Only available dates on the calendars can be selected and dates when the property is unavailable should be greyed out/inactive (Assuming calendars will be used for date selection).
Type: Performance
Rationale: Users need to be provided with an uptodate date range and a property can get booked while other users are browsing it. This refresh will stop any double booking from occurring.  
Fit Criterion: Date of availability will change if a property becomes booked by a different customer while another customer is browsing the same property
Originator: SD

Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[MS] Fit criterion must be measurable. For example, it could be: 100% of validation errors due to busy dates, should be caused by bookings made up to five seconds before the booking whose trying to be submitted
[JS] The description makes reference to a 5s time limit yet the fit criterion does not measure against a timescale.  Alternatively th fit criterion could measure the percentage of occurances that the 5s requirement is met.
[SD] I agree to the above comments that the fit criterion needs to be measurable.
