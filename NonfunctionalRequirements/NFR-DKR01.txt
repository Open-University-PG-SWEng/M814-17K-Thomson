REQ-ID: NFR-DKR01 (amended 13/3)
Description: The product shall ensure the user's confidence in the image upload and storage functionality, by providing clear feedback to the user that the image upload and storage process has either been successful or that it has failed.
Type: 11a/Usability and humanity – ease of use
Rationale: Users may upload property images during a property visit, either from a mobile device or taken directly with a phone camera, and will need to be confident the images have been successfully uploaded and stored before leaving the property. If image upload/storage were to fail, clear feedback will alert the user, giving them the opportunity to retake or reupload images.
Fit Criterion: A sample of users (LandBnb’s customer service agents and representative property owners) will test a prototype image-upload interface using the expected input devices (desktop, mobile device, camera phone), and will correctly identify the outcome of 100% of test cases covering both successful and unsuccessul uploads.
Originator: Arising from functional requirement CS11 (Originator: Ayisha Jayakodi)
Comments: [DKR] This requirement will be important not just for the initial website product (used by LandBnb agents) but also when rolled out to other users (property owners).

[DN] The fit criterion is 100% success of image uploads. This is a measurable fit criterion.

[DKR 13/3] DN's comment suggest abiguity in my original NFR. The successful upload and storage functionality will be tested as part of the fit criterion/testing of FR CS11 while this NFR ensures users' *confidence* in the product's photo upload functionality, part of the product's overall usability. I have amended the Description, Rationale & Fit Criterion to try to remove this ambiguity.
