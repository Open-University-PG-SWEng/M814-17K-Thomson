displayed in “bold font text” on the website home page and footer of every webpage navigated to by users!

[MS] Fit Criterion is restricting the solution when it mentions how contact details has to be shown. The fit criterion should be measurable, for example: it can be tested by a prototype and measure if the percentage of users who can find contact details is greater than a threshold

[BIB] By including a specification such as "bold font text" in the fit criterion solutioneers the requirement. It may well be that there is a better way to display clear contact details. As mentioned by [MS] the fit criterion should be measurable, i.e. present some kind of test the solution will either pass or fail. In addition, in the description we are restricting the contact details to an email address and contact number. It may be that Landbnb have different contact details for different customers (perhaps one for holidaymakers and one for property owners). They may also want to display their address, social media accounts etc.
