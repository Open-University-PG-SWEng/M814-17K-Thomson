Fit Criterion: (i) 95% of a representative population sample group should rate the messages as at least polite, understandable and non-patronising.
(ii) 90% of customers who see the message should visit another page on the site.
(iii) During website usage, the website messages should recieve less than 1% customer complaints.
(iv) During usage, customer satisfaction survey's should show statistically that most (i.e. 90%) found the website friendly, clear, and polite.

Comments: [DN]. To collect data people must be willing to participate in a survery and this can be difficult to organize, therefore the perhaps the 
survery could be built into the website and then the initial data could be collected from people who are willing to test the website. The message itself could 
contain a survey question asking customers for a politeness rating e.g. "how would you rate this message?". Data could then be collected from customers
who visit the site and they could be asked some (maybe 1) customer satisfaction questions.
