Description:  All payment transactions should take place over an encrypted connection.
Type: 15 - Security
Rationale: Payment and personal details such as customer name, address and credit/debit card information can be used in fraud. To stop unauthorized people capturing this data while it is being transmitted, the connection must be secured and encrypted.
Fit Criterion: 
100% of all transactions must be secured with end to end encryption. 100% of all payment transactions should be encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
Originator: Functional Requirement PS17
Comments: [DN] The fit criterion mentions AES and requirements should not solve the problem,  I suggest removing the reference to AES 
and instead state that a network Security consultancy should verify that it is 100% secure from known attacks.
